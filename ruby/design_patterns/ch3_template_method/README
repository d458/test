1. uses Inheritance
2. every object implicitly inherits from Object
3. idea is to build an abstract base class with a skeletal method (template method). The template method drives the of processing that needs to vary, 
but does so by making call to abstract methods, which are then supplied by the concrete subclasses.

4. another example of a template method or optional hook is initialize (contructor) method in every object
